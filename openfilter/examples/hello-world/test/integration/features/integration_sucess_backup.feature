Feature: Handle pipeline misconfiguration and failures

  Scenario: Initialize OCR Filter with invalid engine
    Given an OCR filter configuration with an invalid engine
    When the OCR filter is initialized
    Then it should raise a ValueError

  Scenario: Execute pipeline with missing video file
    Given a configuration with a non-existent video file path
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then it should raise a FileNotFoundError

  Scenario: Execute pipeline with missing outputs
    Given a pipeline configuration without defined outputs
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then it should log a configuration error and not crash

  Scenario: Run pipeline with invalid YAML path
    Given a pipeline YAML path that does not exist
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then it should log an error and abort

  Scenario: Initialize OCR with missing config fields
    Given a configuration missing required fields
    When the filter is initialized
    Then it should raise a KeyError

  Scenario: Handling Missing Video Input
    Given a configuration with a non-existent video file path
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then it should log an error indicating the missing file
    And the pipeline should terminate gracefully

  Scenario: Handling Invalid OCR Engine Configuration
    Given an OCR filter configuration with an invalid engine
    When the OCR filter is initialized
    Then it should raise a ValueError

  Scenario: Handling Missing Required Configuration Fields
    Given a configuration missing required fields for FilterOpticalCharacterRecognition
    When the OCR filter is initialized
    Then it should raise a TypeError or ValueError

  Scenario: Pipeline Termination on Input Stream End (Non-looping)
    Given a sample video input file configured for single-pass playback
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then the pipeline should terminate automatically when the video ends
    And an OCR output file should be created

  Scenario: OCR Text Content Validation
    Given a sample video input file with known text content
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then the OCR output file should contain the expected text results
    And the confidence scores should meet a minimum threshold

  Scenario: Topic Filtering for OCR Processing
    Given a pipeline with multiple video sources on different topics
    And an OCR filter configured to process only a specific topic pattern
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then OCR results should only be generated for frames from the matching topics
    And no OCR results should be present for excluded topics
